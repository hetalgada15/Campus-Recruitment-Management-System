# Campus-Recruitment-Management-System



Background

There are roughly 20,000 students in a university consisting of graduate and undergraduate students. Managing on-campus and off-campus employment is a tedious task for the university.  “Campus Recruitment Management System” is a system which is used to manage a large set of data both on campus and off campus recruitment operations. This comprehensive centralized database will keep track of all entities, including employers advertising co-op opportunities, professors seeking TAs/RAs, and universities offering on-campus jobs.

This database system improves the current university's placement process by informing students about various job requirements and the recruiter's criteria. It will make the job search process more convenient and secure, allowing the student to concentrate solely on acquiring the required skills and meeting all the prerequisites.
